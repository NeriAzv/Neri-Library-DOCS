Command-Line Interface (CLI)
============================

The Neri Library CLI simplifies task execution directly from the terminal. It can be used to identify dependencies of a Python script and generate installation commands.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

   python cli.py script.py

Key Features:
- **Dependency identification**: Analyzes a Python script and identifies the required libraries.
- **Command generation**: Generates installation commands for the identified libraries.

For more details, refer to the full documentation of the CLI.
